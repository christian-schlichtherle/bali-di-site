features:
  - title: Compile-time bindings
    details: Dependency bindings are type-checked by the compiler and if any dependency is missing or incompatible, an error message is emitted.
  - title: Just-in-time resolution
    details: Dependencies are created and (if desired) cached just-in-time by calling abstract methods, so that your application can startup quickly.
  - title: Named dependencies
    details: Dependencies are named, so that the compiler can always discern two dependencies named <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, even if they have the same type.
  - title: No runtime artifacts
    details: All necessary code is generated by the compiler, so that there are no runtime artifacts and it doesn't break byte code analysis or transformation tools.
  - title: Simple and scalable
    details: Dependencies are defined in module contexts or types. Module types can get composed into large systems by composition or inheritance.
  - title: Supports Java and Scala
    details: Bali DI is implemented as an annotation processor in Java and as a def macro in Scala. You can even use it in mixed Java/Scala/Scala.js projects.
  - title: Mix & match with JSR 330
    details: Bali DI is completely complementary to Spring, Guice, Macwire, CDI or any other JSR 330 implementation, so that you can use both in the same project.
  - title: No IDE plugin required
    details: The Java annotation processor emits formatted source code, so that you can easily inspect your dependency bindings and their caching.
  - title: Effectively eliminates <code>new</code>
    details: The design is based on abstract types, which are hard to implement manually. This is an effective deterrent to accidentally <code>new</code> a dependency type.
